# Welcome to the BIRDS Open Source Project Repository

The BIRDS program, developed by Kyushu Institute of Technology, is an educational initiative focused on CubeSat development. 
This repository serves as a central hub for open-sourcing files, code, and designs from the BIRDS program, enabling other entities to utilize and contribute to the advancement of CubeSat technology. The BIRDS Open Source project is committed to demonstrating lean satellite development that is well documented, easy to adapt and debug, and that caters to the needs of the entire satellite development workflow, from satellite design configurations to ground station data collection and analysis.

## About the BIRDS Program:

The BIRDS program provides hands-on training in satellite engineering, project management, and cross-cultural teamwork. 
Through the development of CubeSats, students from non-space-faring nations gain practical experience and contribute to global capacity building in space technology.
A CubeSat is a type of small satellite that is made up of multiple standard cubic units. 
One CubeSat unit (1U) is an extremely small satellite of 10 x 10 x 10 [cm], with a mass less than 1.33 kg. 
Originally, it was proposed as an educational tool for space engineering technology, given its small size, light mass, and low budget. 
It is a very good representative of the “lean satellite” concept recently proposed in an International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) study. 

Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) has been carrying out its BIRDS program since 2015. In the program, inexperienced student members receive training and develop multiple 1U CubeSats. Each BIRDS project develops 1U CubeSats for the capacity building of non-space-faring nations. As of Febuary 2024, six generations of BIRDS projects have been carried
out: 
* BIRDS-1,
* BIRDS-2,
* BIRDS-3,
* BIRDS-4,
* BIRDS-5, and
* BIRDS-X.

The BIRDS program is a unique educational program that provides an excellent opportunity for learning systems
engineering, project management, and cross-cultural teamwork, not only conventional space technologies.  

The BIRDS BUS is a standard CubeSat bus of electrical design to support the BIRDS program. The design puts an emphasis on ease for beginners to learn and use it. 
For example, the BIRDS BUS uses a distributed system design, not for its performance but for the easy work sharing and simple coding work involved. 

## Organisation structure
This treasure trove of information can seem quite daunting to someone on first encounter, so let's go through the repositories we have in this organisation one by one so you can find what you need with ease.

If you're curious about the BIRDS program itself, the [BIRDS Program Textbook](https://github.com/BIRDSOpenSource/BIRDS-GeneralDocumentation) is readily available in its own repository with the complementary Interface Control documents, both in `English` and `Japanese`.

### Key Features:

Educational Focus: Practical learning experiences for students, emphasizing systems engineering and international collaboration.

Accessible Design: Utilization of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts and a distributed system design for ease of use and cost-effectiveness.

Capacity Building: Each BIRDS project aims to empower non-space-faring nations by developing CubeSats tailored to their needs.

### How to Contribute:

Use and Adapt: Feel free to utilize the files, code, and designs in this repository for your own CubeSat projects.

Improve and Collaborate: Contribute your enhancements, modifications, or feedback to improve the quality and accessibility of CubeSat technology.



By open-sourcing our resources, we aim to foster innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing in the CubeSat community. 
Together, let's continue pushing the boundaries of space exploration and education.
